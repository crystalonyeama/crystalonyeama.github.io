subtitle: Trustworthy Multimodal AI for Skin Cancer Detection
project_title: "Trustworthy Multimodal AI for Skin Cancer Detection"

problem: |
  Existing AI systems for skin cancer detection are often trained on non-diverse datasets, which leads to diagnostic bias â€” especially underperforming on darker skin tones. This disparity results in delayed diagnoses and limits trust in AI-assisted dermatology tools. Current solutions also lack transparency, making it difficult for clinicians and patients to understand or verify how decisions are made.

  Our project addresses this gap by developing a fair and trustworthy AI model capable of accurate skin cancer detection across a wide range of skin tones. Ensuring interpretability and inclusiveness in diagnostic systems is critical to achieving equitable healthcare outcomes.

approach: |
  Our research takes a multimodal and fairness-aware approach:

  - Collect and analyze skin lesion image datasets alongside patient metadata
  - Apply fairness-aware deep learning methods to mitigate bias in model training
  - Integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency
  - Evaluate model performance across diverse skin tones and demographic groups

  We are also conducting a literature review on existing diagnostic AI models, focusing on fairness, accuracy, and interpretability, while exploring datasets such as ISIC and the MRA-MIDAS dataset. Tools used include Python, OpenCV, and common deep learning libraries.

outcome: |
  The goal is to build an improved AI model that offers unbiased skin cancer detection and can clearly explain its predictions to both clinicians and patients. By the end of the program, we aim to deliver a functional prototype, a technical poster, and a detailed literature review summarizing challenges and progress in fair, explainable medical AI. This work will contribute to the broader mission of building inclusive and trustworthy healthcare technologies.
