  bio: |
   22 and freshly graduated, I'm passionate about skincare and the science behind it. Exploring how beauty and innovation blend to create confident, glowing skin!

   My work explores the intersection of skincare and technology—how data-driven tools, smart devices, and digital platforms can empower people to better understand and care for their skin.

   When I’m not diving into the science of skin health, I enjoy experimenting with new formulations, learning about cosmetic chemistry, and staying up to date with the latest beauty tech innovations.
