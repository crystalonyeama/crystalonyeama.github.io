  bio: |
    Dr. Saroj Pramanik is an Associate Professor of Biology at Morgan State University with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi. His extensive research spans bioremediation, somatic embryogenesis, protein synthesis, and cancer drug development. He is particularly interested in translational control of gene expression during cellular differentiation and the use of plant-microbial systems to remediate toxic chemicals.

    Dr. Pramanik has taught a range of biology courses, including introductory biology for non-majors and advanced topics in plant physiology and biotechnology. His research has been widely published in peer-reviewed journals, covering subjects from cancer therapeutics to molecular biology and plant science. He is actively involved in developing biomarkers for cancer detection and exploring new chemotherapeutic compounds.

    Although I’ve only recently met Dr. Pramanik, he presents himself as knowledgeable and approachable. I’m looking forward to learning from his deep expertise in molecular biology and biochemistry, and gaining insight into how lab research can contribute to real-world medical and environmental solutions.
