what_i_learned: |
  We started off the day continuing our Python lessons using W3Schools, building on what we began earlier in the week. After a while, we took a break from our screens with a quick icebreaker to reset and refocus. It was a nice way to break up the day and reenergize.

  Later, we worked on a project planning assignment. We answered questions about what part of our project we wanted to focus on, the models and techniques we plan to use, the milestones we want to hit each week, and what kind of support we’ll need from our mentor, Blessing. It helped give more structure to our ideas and reminded us of what’s ahead.

  After that, we went back to reading and practicing more Python. We ended the day with a Kahoot quiz to test what we’ve learned so far.

  Some concepts in Python are still a bit confusing to me—like working with sets and certain string operations. Even though we reviewed them together, I know it’ll take more practice before it clicks fully. It’s not that it’s too hard, just a lot to remember when it’s all still so new.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a mix of learning and planning, which was helpful. I appreciated having the chance to think about my project direction and also check my Python understanding through the Kahoot. Even when things feel challenging, I know I’m making progress—and I’m excited to keep going and get better with time.
