what_i_learned: |
  We began the morning with an encouraging conversation led by Mr. Felix and our mentor, Blessing, on the importance of networking and how to leverage professional relationships—even when starting from limited resources or unfamiliar environments. Their advice reinforced the value of proactive outreach and continuous learning to move our careers forward.

  Immediately afterwards, we returned to our codebase and finally resolved the persistent issue of missing file extensions that had been preventing our training pipeline from loading images correctly. Seeing the model run without those errors was a huge relief and a major step forward.  

  After lunch, we shifted focus to creating our weekly presentation slides and recording update videos that summarize the week’s progress and outline next week’s objectives. This exercise helped clarify our achievements and identify upcoming priorities.  

  To close out the day, we tackled the remaining data‐quality problem in one of our datasets—rows containing `NaN` values in critical columns. We explored several strategies, ultimately choosing to impute or remove missing entries depending on context, and continued refining our model architecture now that the data pipeline is more stable.

  The primary blocker today was handling the `NaN` values embedded in the dataset. Determining when to impute versus drop records required careful consideration to avoid introducing bias.

reflection: |
  Today balanced soft‐skill development with tangible technical wins. The networking discussion set a motivational tone, while fixing the file extension bug and addressing missing values gave us measurable progress on the model. Preparing the weekly presentation also provided a structured way to reflect on our growth and maintain momentum for the week ahead.
