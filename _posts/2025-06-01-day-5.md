  Today was our first in-person session after a week of virtual learning, and it really brought the program to life. We started the day with introductions from everyone—including the program coordinators, directors, faculty mentors, graduate student mentors, and all of us, the participants. It helped to put faces to the names we’ve seen online and created a sense of community.

  We revisited the expectations and structure of the institute to get everyone aligned, and then jumped into our first icebreaker: the noodle and marshmallow game. It was a fun challenge that required teamwork and quick thinking. After that, we took a group photo to mark the moment.

  Once the icebreakers wrapped up, we broke into our assigned project groups. My group began diving into the research side of our project by reading academic papers related to our topic. It felt good to finally start laying the groundwork for our work ahead.

  I experienced a bit of social anxiety today. Being in a new environment around so many new faces made me feel nervous at first, but I’m hoping it gets easier as we settle into a routine and get to know each other better.

  There’s something really motivating about being in the same space as everyone, sharing ideas and energy. I’m starting to see the big picture come together. The noodle and marshmallow game was a great way to break the ice, and jumping into research made the day feel productive. I’m excited to continue building out our project and learning from my teammates in the days ahead.
