what_i_learned: |
  Today we had a guest speaker who gave an insightful talk on electronegativity, the brain, and human-computer interaction. He also shared details about his upbringing and the research his lab is conducting. It was fascinating to hear how his personal experiences shaped his scientific journey.

  After the talk, we participated in two hands-on EEG-based exercises. In the first, we controlled the movement of a robotic machine by clenching our fists, which changed its direction. In the second activity, we flew drones using neural commands—either blinking or clenching our teeth to shift the drone’s path. Both activities showed us how brain-muscle signals can be translated into real-world control.

  After our break, we continued running our model and made more progress on our research paper.

blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today, though model training remains a time-intensive process that we’re steadily working through.

reflection: |
  The EEG demonstrations were not only fun but also opened our eyes to new applications of human-computer interaction. It was exciting to see how these advanced technologies connect to real-world control, and the guest speaker’s journey was both inspiring and educational.
