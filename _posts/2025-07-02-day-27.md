what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about wrapping things up for tomorrow’s mid-summer presentation. My group and I finalized our PowerPoint slides, polished our script, and focused on recording our demo video. After several rounds of practice, we finally got a solid take that clearly explains our project, how the model works, and what progress we’ve made so far. It was a big relief to get through the full run without major hiccups, and I think all the earlier practice really helped us deliver confidently.

  We made sure the demo showcased the model’s improved accuracy and how we’ve been building and testing the code together. Although the process was repetitive at times, it helped us become more comfortable explaining both the technical and non-technical aspects of our project.

  The biggest challenge today was staying within the time limit while still covering all the important parts of our work. It took a few tries to find the right balance between detail and brevity.

reflection: |
  Even though today was mostly spent practicing, I feel more prepared and proud of the work we’ve done. Creating a clear and concise demo helped reinforce how far we’ve come since the beginning. Now we just need to stay focused and deliver tomorrow with confidence.
