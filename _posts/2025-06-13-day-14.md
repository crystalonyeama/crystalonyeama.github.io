what_i_learned: |
  Today was a continuation of the technical work we started yesterday, focused on cleaning and merging our datasets. We worked on standardizing column names across all three datasets to ensure consistency, and began removing null values so that we could prepare for merging. One of the challenges we ran into was that our null-handling code wasn’t throwing clear errors, which made it hard to debug. After some time troubleshooting, our mentor Blessing helped us identify what was going wrong, and we were able to move forward. Once we got to the merging step, we encountered another issue where the datasets refused to align even though the columns had the same names. We’re still working through that, but overall, we made strong progress and gained a better understanding of the kind of data prep work that goes into real-world machine learning projects.

blockers: |
  Debugging code that didn’t throw obvious errors when handling null values was difficult. We also ran into issues with datasets not merging properly even after standardizing column names.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that progress isn’t always linear when it comes to data science. Even small errors in formatting or inconsistencies between datasets can cause major blocks, and it takes patience and collaboration to work through them. I’m grateful for the help we received and motivated by the fact that we’re getting closer to having a usable dataset for our model.
