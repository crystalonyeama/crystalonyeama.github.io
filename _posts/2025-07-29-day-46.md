what_i_learned: |
  Today my group and I shifted our focus toward preparing the PowerPoint presentation for our final showcase. We reviewed the overall structure of the presentation and divided up the slide responsibilities among our team members.

  I was assigned the results section, where I will be presenting the performance metrics of the four models we used—DCAN, XGBoost, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0. My role includes explaining each model’s accuracy, strengths, and how they compare to one another in terms of classification performance. Organizing this data and thinking through how to communicate it clearly to our audience gave me a better grasp of what the numbers actually say about our models and how effective they are.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just making sure we format the results in a clean and understandable way that’s visually engaging for the presentation.

reflection: |
  Working on the results section has helped tie everything together. It’s rewarding to finally see our models’ performance side-by-side and realize how far our project has come. I’m excited to walk our audience through the outcomes and the insights they offer.
