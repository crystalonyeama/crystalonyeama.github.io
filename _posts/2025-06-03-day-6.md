what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first full day in the labs, and it was all about getting comfortable with Python. We used W3Schools as our guide, taking time to read through sections, quiz ourselves, and watch tutorials to reinforce what we learned. One by one, each of us went up to the board to demonstrate some of the skills we’ve been building throughout the day.

  I made it through a good number of sections including syntax, comments, variables, data types, numbers, casting, and strings. It felt productive to really slow down and soak in the basics. Each topic helped me see how Python works behind the scenes.

blockers: |
  The toughest section for me was strings—not because it was super difficult, but because it introduced a lot of information at once. Trying to absorb so much in one go was a bit overwhelming, but I’m determined to revisit it and become more confident with time.

reflection: |
  I’m really glad we had a hands-on lab day. Having time to explore Python at our own pace and then share what we learned on the board helped boost my confidence. Even though there’s a lot to learn, I’m excited to keep going and start connecting the dots between all the concepts.
