what_i_learned: |
  Today we started by reviewing the exact models we plan to implement for our project, making sure we had a shared understanding of how we’ll begin structuring them. After that, we revisited the merging process for our datasets, since many of us are still trying to fully grasp the logic behind merging properly and cleaning real-world data. To help reinforce the concepts, our mentor Blessing assigned us a mini project that closely mimicked what we’ll be doing for our main project. The goal was to help us become more confident with dataset handling and cleaning through hands-on coding.

  The practice task involved several important steps: standardizing column names like `pid` and `id` into a consistent `patient_id`, identifying and merging records across datasets by unique patients, resolving missing data by pulling non-null values from whichever dataset had them available, and standardizing gender values to “Male” or “Female.” We also had to make decisions about which columns to drop or retain and explain our reasoning before outputting a clean, unified DataFrame to a CSV file. Going through this process step by step gave me a much clearer understanding of what to look for when cleaning and merging data, and I felt a lot more comfortable with the code by the end.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today, just continuing to build confidence with merging logic and learning how to think through data cleaning decisions more independently.

reflection: |
  I really appreciated having the chance to do a hands-on mini project that mirrored what our actual project will require. It helped solidify the logic behind merging and cleaning datasets, and gave me space to apply the skills we’ve been learning in a more focused way. I'm starting to feel more confident handling messy data, and the repetition is definitely helping it stick.
