what_i_learned: |
  I met the faculty member, Dr. Saroj, and our graduate mentor, Blessing. They introduced the structure of the program and gave us an overview of what to expect, while we all got to know each other.

  Our group topic—skin—was introduced with a fun fact: it’s the largest organ in the body. We then worked on setting up and refining our websites by updating the "Home," "About Me," and "My Blog" sections.

  Later, we split into learning groups based on skill level. I joined the Python 101 group to strengthen my foundational knowledge. We covered basics like printing, arithmetic operations, and the order of operations in Python. To wrap up, we played a Kahoot game to check our understanding in a fun, interactive way.

  Today was a strong start—I appreciated getting to meet the team and better understand the goals of the program. Learning that skin is actually the body’s largest organ made me more curious about how science connects with everyday topics.

  Diving into Python basics reminded me that foundational skills are essential, and I felt more confident by the end of the session. The Kahoot was a fun way to reinforce what we learned, and I’m excited to keep building from here.
