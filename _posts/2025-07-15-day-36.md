what_i_learned: |
  I was out of the program today due to a scheduled personal appointment. Although I wasn’t able to participate in the day’s activities in person, I made sure to stay in the loop by checking in with my group and reviewing any shared updates or materials.

  Being away reminded me how valuable it is to work with a team that communicates well and documents progress clearly. I’m grateful for my group keeping things organized so I can pick right back up tomorrow.

blockers: |
  The only blocker today was being away due to the appointment. While I missed out on the hands-on work, I made sure to check in so I won’t fall behind.

reflection: |
  Even on days when we step away, there’s still value in staying connected and being prepared to return focused. I’m looking forward to catching up and continuing our momentum tomorrow.
