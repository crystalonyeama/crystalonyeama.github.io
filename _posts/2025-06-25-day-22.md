what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on strengthening our understanding of neural networks and their applications in machine learning. We watched a series of instructional videos covering key concepts such as prediction with neural networks, the differences between overfitting and underfitting, and the distinctions between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning approaches. We also explored data augmentation as a technique for improving model generalization, learned how one-hot encoding works for categorical variables, and reviewed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their role in deep learning.

  After the video lessons, we transitioned into a literature review session where we examined additional scholarly articles to deepen our grasp of the technical material. These readings provided real-world context for the models and strategies we’ve been discussing.

  To end the day, we met virtually with both our faculty mentor and graduate mentor to reflect on the day’s topics, ask clarifying questions, and receive feedback on how we’re progressing with the material.

blockers: |
  No significant blockers today—just continuing to absorb and retain all the new technical information. There's a lot to take in, but the video format and article readings helped reinforce the concepts.

reflection: |
  Today’s focus on learning through multiple formats—videos, articles, and mentor discussions—helped tie together many of the complex ideas we’ve been tackling. It reminded me that reinforcement through repetition and discussion is key when dealing with advanced topics like deep learning. I’m starting to feel more confident in my understanding and am excited to apply what we’ve learned to our model.
