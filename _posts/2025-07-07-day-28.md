  We kicked off the day by reviewing the video of our mid-summer presentation from last week. It was helpful to reflect on how we performed—both in terms of what went well and what could be improved. We also went over the audience feedback and questions to better understand where we can refine our project and our delivery. That conversation gave us clearer direction on the final steps we need to take to make our end-of-program presentation even stronger.

  Afterward, our group collaborated on a list of improvements and features we want to implement in the coming weeks. One key area we focused on was finding more diverse skin tone datasets to enhance the fairness and robustness of our model. We successfully found three additional datasets that we can integrate into our analysis, which will help improve both representation and performance.

  In the afternoon, we revisited our code, specifically focusing on cleaning the `diagnosis` column. Our mentor Blessing guided us in resolving the remaining inconsistencies and merging all variations into a single, clean label structure. This will make the training process more efficient and ensure we’re working with a more reliable dataset.

  Minor setbacks in cleaning and standardizing the `diagnosis` column slowed us down, but with guidance, we were able to get past it and align our data correctly.

  Reviewing our presentation was both humbling and motivating. It reminded me how far we've come but also how much more we can still improve. Today’s progress—especially in expanding our dataset and refining our labels—puts us in a strong position as we gear up for the final stretch of the program.
