what_i_learned: |
  Today we had another workshop with the Writing Center, where we went over key aspects of presenting and polishing our research paper. The session included a detailed walkthrough of a sample presentation and gave us valuable tips on improving our paper’s clarity, formatting, and flow. We discussed how to frame our research questions, integrate effective visuals, and strengthen the language in our methodology and results sections.

  Dr. Pandey emphasized multimodal writing strategies, audience-centered communication, and how to maintain cohesion across sections. It was especially helpful to see concrete examples of how to make our work more accessible to both technical and non-technical readers.

  After the session, we spent the rest of the day bonding as a team—we went out together and had a seafood boil, which was a fun and relaxing way to celebrate our progress and recharge for the next phase of the project.

blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today. It was a lighter day focused on communication skills and team connection, which was a welcome change of pace.

reflection: |
  The workshop was a great reminder that strong technical work needs strong communication to have an impact. It helped me think more critically about how we present our findings and how important it is to write with our audience in mind. The group outing also reinforced how important our team dynamic is—we work better when we feel connected.
