what_i_learned: |
  We began the morning with a full-group meeting led by Dr. Mack. She confirmed that our GAD payments have been processed, outlined expectations for Friday’s mid-summer presentation, and reminded us to arrive by 9:30 AM in business-professional or business-casual attire. She also explained that presentation order will be announced on the day of, and—since we are presenting live—we will not need to record the usual weekly video update or post a Friday blog entry.  

  After the meeting, my team devoted the remainder of the day to refining our training code. We focused on ensuring our image pipeline runs smoothly from data loading through preprocessing and augmentation, and we began iterating on hyperparameters for our baseline CNN. Working through the code together helped clarify individual responsibilities and highlighted areas for efficiency improvements before our live demonstration.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today; our main challenge is ensuring the training script remains stable as we continue to tweak parameters and add functionality.

reflection: |
  Today felt like a transition from planning to execution. Dr. Mack’s briefing clarified logistical details, and spending the afternoon in focused coding sessions gave us momentum heading into Friday. I’m looking forward to showcasing our progress and seeing how other teams have advanced.
