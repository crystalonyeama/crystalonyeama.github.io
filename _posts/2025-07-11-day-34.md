  Today was a productive and steady-paced workday. We picked up right where we left off with dataset cleaning and preprocessing, continuing to refine and prepare our skin lesion datasets for modeling. Afterward, we shifted our focus toward exploring new classification techniques to complement or potentially improve upon our current approach.

  We researched three advanced interpretability and classification algorithms: **DCAN (Dual Channel Attention Network)**, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, and **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)**. These tools will allow us to not only improve image classification performance, but also to interpret what features the model is learning from—an important aspect of trustworthy AI.

  After reading through documentation and use cases, we located base implementations of each algorithm and uploaded them to our shared Google Drive for future integration. We wrapped up the day by working on our team’s weekly presentation slides and recording the video update to summarize our progress.

  No major blockers today, but we need to dedicate time next week to experimenting with and validating how well these new algorithms work with our datasets.

  Introducing algorithms like Grad-CAM and SHAP brings our project one step closer to explainable AI, a critical requirement for medical applications. I'm excited to see how these interpretability tools can enhance our analysis and model trustworthiness moving forward.
