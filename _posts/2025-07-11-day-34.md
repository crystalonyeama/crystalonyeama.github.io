what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive Friday that built on the data preprocessing work we started yesterday. 
  My group and I resumed where we left off with cleaning and prepping our datasets, but our main 
  focus shifted to exploring new algorithms to enhance our image classification capabilities.

  We researched three key algorithms—DCAN (Dual Channel Attention Network), SHAP (SHapley Additive ExPlanations), 
  and Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)—to understand how each could be implemented to provide 
  model explainability and improve classification performance. Once we found base code and documentation for each, 
  we added them to our shared Google Drive for further experimentation.

  We wrapped up the day by creating and recording our weekly presentation video, which summarized our progress 
  and outlined our next steps moving forward.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today. Researching the algorithms was straightforward, and we were able to find reliable sources 
  and sample code for all three methods.

reflection: |
  I’m excited about the potential of incorporating explainable AI methods into our model. It’s one thing to make 
  predictions—but being able to explain **why** a model makes a prediction takes it to the next level. It was 
  also great to see how much more comfortable I’m getting with both the technical and presentation aspects of our project.
