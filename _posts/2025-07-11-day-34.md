what_i_learned: |
  Today was a relatively simple but productive day. My group and I picked up where we left off with cleaning and preprocessing our datasets. Once we had that in motion, we shifted our focus to exploring algorithms that could help us better classify and interpret image data.

  We researched three key algorithms: DCAN, Grad-CAM, and SHAP. Each of these techniques provides insight into how models interpret image features, which is useful for both accuracy and transparency. After reviewing them, we located starter implementations and saved them into our shared Google Drive to serve as base templates we can build from later.

  To close out the day, we worked together to design our weekly presentation slides and record a demo video highlighting our recent progress.

blockers: |
  No significant blockers today—everything ran smoothly, although researching the algorithms took some time due to the complexity of the concepts.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed learning about interpretability methods and thinking about how we could apply them to our model. I feel like we’re growing more confident in navigating both technical and communication tasks, and today’s collaboration felt well-balanced and energizing.
