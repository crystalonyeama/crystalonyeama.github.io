  Today was all about working hands-on with the datasets we’ll be using for our project. We started by searching for high-quality datasets that included a broad and diverse range of skin tones. After reviewing several options, we narrowed it down to three datasets that best fit our goals. Once we finalized our choices, we loaded each dataset into Python so we could begin interacting with the data directly. The next step was to start thinking about how we might merge these datasets into one unified source. We looked closely at each dataset's structure to identify similarities—especially focusing on shared columns like image file names and lesion diagnoses, such as whether a lesion was malignant or benign. These common fields will help us align the data more easily and ensure we're building a cohesive foundation for training our model.

  Later in the day, we split into smaller teams to explore scholarly articles related to our work. My group found a very insightful article that took a deeper dive into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While we’ve always had an idea that CNNs would be part of our model architecture, this article expanded our understanding of how different CNN architectures function and gave us ideas about which versions might work best depending on the features we want to extract. Learning about the flexibility and variety in CNN designs really opened our eyes to how much control we have in shaping the model’s behavior and performance. Overall, today helped bridge the gap between dataset preparation and model strategy in a very real way.

  I didn’t really have any blockers today. My focus now is on continuing to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of the tools we’re using.

reflection: |
  I enjoyed today's mix of technical work and research. Searching for the right datasets and thinking through how to merge them made me feel like we’re moving into a more serious, hands-on phase of the project. Learning more about CNNs through research was motivating, and I’m starting to feel more confident in how all the pieces of this project are going to come together.
