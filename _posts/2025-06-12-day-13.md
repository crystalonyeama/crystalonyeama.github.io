what_i_learned: |
  Today started with our weekly group meeting where we went around and introduced ourselves again, group by group. One person from each group was selected to share updates on their progress, and I had the opportunity to speak on behalf of mine. It felt good to explain how far we’ve come and reflect on our growth as a team. After the updates, we split into two groups for some fun and competitive games. We started with Taboo, which was super entertaining even though my team lost. We followed that with a quick game of Jenga—and even though it was short, it paid off because my team won an hour of flex time to either arrive late or leave early on another day!

  After the games, we were introduced to Overleaf, which we’ll be using to write our final paper. For now, we created a practice document about ourselves, our mentors, and our blog posts. This was due by 12:35 PM and gave us a chance to get comfortable with the Overleaf platform. After lunch, we dove back into our technical work and began merging the datasets we had selected earlier in the week. We took a deeper look at our code and were able to successfully rename columns across all three datasets so that they matched one another. This step was important because having consistent column names will make the merging process smoother and reduce the chances of errors later on. The progress we made today really pushed our project forward and gave us momentum going into the next phase.

  I didn’t have any blockers today. Blessing helped me out with the merging code, which made the process easier and helped solidify my understanding of how to align datasets properly.

reflection: |
  Today was a great balance of collaboration, creativity, and technical progress. Starting the day with games and team bonding helped lighten the mood, and it made the rest of the workday feel even more productive. I’m proud of the technical progress we made with the dataset merging, and I’m feeling more confident using Overleaf for formal writing. Things are really starting to come together.
