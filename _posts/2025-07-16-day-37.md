what_i_learned: |
  Today we focused entirely on developing the methodology section of our research paper. We began by reviewing everything we’ve done so far in order to clearly document the process we've followed throughout the project. This included outlining our data collection, cleaning, model selection, training, and evaluation steps.

  We also created a comprehensive table that detailed the datasets we’ve used, including relevant attributes, sources, and number of samples. To further support our explanation, we built a visual diagram that maps out our entire project pipeline—from raw image data to classification and evaluation.

  Collaborating on this section gave us the chance to reflect on how much progress we've made and helped ensure our workflow is presented clearly for both technical and non-technical readers.

blockers: |
  There weren’t any technical blockers today, but it did take some time to align on the wording and structure of the methodology section as a group to make sure it flowed well and represented our work accurately.

reflection: |
  Writing out the methodology reminded me of how important it is to document your steps as you go. Seeing it all laid out made me proud of how far we’ve come, and it’s exciting to move into the final stages of the paper.
