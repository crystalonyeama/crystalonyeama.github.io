what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on thoroughly reviewing the entire codebase line by line in preparation for the upcoming demo video on Thursday. It was helpful to slow down and make sure I truly understood how each section contributed to our model-building process. After the review, my group and I moved forward with training the model. The first training run showed poor accuracy, but after revisiting the code and adjusting some parameters, we ran it two more times and saw a significant improvement. When we tested the model with sample images, it started correctly identifying matches between the predicted and actual classifications, which was exciting.

  Later in the day, we began planning our presentation flow. We practiced presenting the slides and explaining our code like we would during the mid-summer presentation. The first couple of rounds didn’t go very well, especially since one of our teammates was missing, but we talked through it and came up with ways to improve. I’m feeling more confident that with some at-home revisions tonight, tomorrow will go much smoother.

  Practicing the presentation without our full team made it tough to stay on rhythm and present everything with confidence. Also, fine-tuning the model parameters took a few trials before getting results we were happy with.

reflection: |
  Today taught me how important it is to not just know the code—but also know how to explain it clearly and confidently. Training the model was a rewarding challenge, and practicing the presentation helped highlight areas where we need to sharpen our delivery. I’m glad we’re putting in the work now so that our demo will be polished by Thursday.
