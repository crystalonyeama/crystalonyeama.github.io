what_i_learned: |
  We started off the day by exploring Morgan's campus and learning about the different buildings used for various majors. It was cool to see where students in different disciplines spend their time. We also got to check out the buildings for food, fitness, and relaxation—places where we can eat, go to the gym, or just unwind in between work.

  After returning from break, my group jumped into a Kahoot session as a quick refresher on everything we’ve covered so far in Python. Right after that, Blessing gave each of us a mini coding project tailored to what we’ve been learning. My task was to create a palindrome function using a for loop.

  It wasn’t too complicated since I understood the core concepts already, but I wasn’t using them quite right at first. My function ran, but the output wasn’t correct. With some small adjustments, I was able to fix it.

blockers: |
  Honestly, my biggest blocker today was just hoping I remember how to get to the right buildings next time! Navigating a new campus can be a little overwhelming, especially when your memory isn't the best.

reflection: |
  Today blended movement and coding in a way that kept things fresh. Getting out and walking around campus helped me feel more connected to the space I’m working in. The mini project reminded me how important it is to not just understand concepts—but to apply them correctly. I know with more practice, I’ll continue to grow.
