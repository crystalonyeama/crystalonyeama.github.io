what_i_learned: |
  Today, I dedicated most of my time to editing our 90-second elevator pitch video. I wanted to make sure it looked polished, creative, and engaging while still maintaining a professional tone that matched the importance of our project. It was a fun challenge to balance style and substance in such a short timeframe.

  Alongside the video work, we continued training and refining our model. That meant running new versions of the code, troubleshooting issues, and making adjustments to improve our accuracy results. It was a true team effort as we tried to push the model performance as far as possible.

blockers: |
  Video editing took longer than expected as I tested different effects, transitions, and cuts to strike the right tone. Meanwhile, model accuracy tuning required extra debugging to ensure consistency and minimize errors.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me how much storytelling matters in tech. Whether it’s through code or video, how we present our work can really shape how others perceive it. I’m proud of how much progress we’ve made—both technically and creatively.
