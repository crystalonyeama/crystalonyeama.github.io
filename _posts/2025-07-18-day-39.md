what_i_learned: |
  Today was dedicated to refining and finalizing key sections of our research paper. As a group, we focused on completing the introduction, abstract, background, and methodology sections. While the first three had already been drafted earlier in the week, we returned to them to clean up the writing, ensure consistency, and align them with our evolving project structure.

  Most of our time was spent wrapping up the methodology section, which required close attention to detail. We made sure every data processing step was clearly documented and supported with visuals and tables. By collaborating on these core sections, we were able to ensure that our paper accurately reflects both our technical workflow and the goals of our project.

blockers: |
  There were no major blockers today, though we did take extra time making sure the different writing styles from each group member blended smoothly throughout the document.

reflection: |
  Writing the final paper has really highlighted the importance of both teamwork and documentation. It’s rewarding to see all of our research and code come together into a cohesive narrative that showcases our work and its impact.
