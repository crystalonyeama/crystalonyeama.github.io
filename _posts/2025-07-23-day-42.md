what_i_learned: |
  Today was heavily focused on training our models, which took up the majority of the day due to the time-intensive nature of the process. While the training was running in the background, I worked with my group to begin designing the wireframe for our website. We discussed layout ideas, navigation structure, and how to clearly showcase our model and its purpose.

  We also explored different hosting platforms and began looking into how to acquire a domain name for our project. In addition to the technical work, we began preparing and rehearsing our script for the 90-second elevator pitch video that we plan to film tomorrow.

blockers: |
  Model training and zipping the image files took significantly longer than expected, which slowed down our ability to fully test and validate results. It’s something we’ll continue tomorrow.

reflection: |
  It was exciting to see everything coming together—the model, the website, and the presentation. Juggling both the backend technical work and the frontend planning gave me a deeper appreciation for how multi-layered this project is. I'm looking forward to recording our pitch and continuing to fine-tune our platform.
