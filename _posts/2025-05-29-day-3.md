what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about computer vision and got hands-on experience using Visual Studio with both photo and video inputs. We explored how computers interpret visual data, which was really exciting. We also participated in a fun escape room activity that helped build our team communication and problem-solving skills. Later in the day, we split into rooms 101 and 102 again to continue improving our Python skills, just like yesterday. We focused on core concepts like variables, input, and output, and I feel like I understand them much better now.

reflection: |
  Today was a mix of technical learning and personal growth. Working with computer vision made me realize how powerful and complex technology can be, and it got me thinking about how these tools are used in the real world. The escape room was a highlight—it reminded me how important teamwork and communication are, especially when solving tough problems. I also appreciated the Python breakout sessions because they gave me a chance to ask questions and really dig into the basics. I'm starting to feel more confident in my coding skills and more comfortable working with others.
