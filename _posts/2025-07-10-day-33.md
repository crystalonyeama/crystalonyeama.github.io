  Today started with a presentation hosted by the university’s Writing Center in Room 112. The session focused on the importance of strong writing, especially as it applies to technical and research-based projects like ours. The presenters engaged with us by asking questions about the writing struggles we’ve faced so far—such as structuring our thoughts, transitioning between paragraphs, or crafting a strong introduction. One of the biggest takeaways was the power of creating a solid outline before writing, to help guide our ideas and keep things organized.

  They also emphasized the importance of clear titles, compelling introductions (especially with relevant statistics), smooth transitions, and proper referencing. We even did a short interactive activity where we had to create an attention-grabbing intro and title. The presenter had a strong background in language and writing, which made the information even more helpful and credible. It was a great reminder that technical knowledge is only part of what makes a project strong—how we communicate our findings matters just as much.

  After lunch, we switched back into project work mode. My group decided to split up our dataset preprocessing tasks to work more efficiently. Instead of collaborating on a single file, each of us tackled a dataset we had found. I was proud to work independently and make strong progress on preprocessing my assigned dataset. It felt good to apply the skills we've been developing and see how much I’ve grown in handling the process on my own.

  No major blockers today. It was a productive and smooth day overall, and I appreciated having both writing support and technical time to focus.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that communication is just as important as coding in a research project. Learning how to structure my writing and tell a compelling story will help a lot with our final paper. I also feel proud of the progress I made working independently—it showed me how much more confident I’m becoming in my technical abilities.
