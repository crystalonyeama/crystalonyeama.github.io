what_i_learned: |
  Today I focused on building the website that will serve as the final platform to showcase our model and bring all the elements of our project together. Designing the structure and layout helped me think through how we want users to interact with our work, and what features will best communicate the project’s purpose and impact.

  In the second half of the day, I continued developing the website, but also rejoined my group as we transitioned into model training. We ran into a slowdown when it came time to zip the image files needed for training—this step took a long time and, by the end of the day, still hadn’t finished. We plan to pick it up again tomorrow and continue with the training process.

blockers: |
  The main blocker today was the image zipping process taking much longer than expected, which delayed the start of full training.

reflection: |
  It’s exciting to see everything finally coming together—our site, our code, and our trained model. Even though file management slowed us down, I’m proud of the progress
