what_i_learned: |
  Today started with our weekly group meeting, where Dr. Mack gave an overview of the upcoming weekly presentation videos. She walked us through the requirements, shared updates about the GAD process for our payments, and reviewed the schedule and expectations for our official progress presentation happening next week on the 27th. Afterward, we practiced short personal introduction pitches we’ll be using to introduce ourselves to the high school teachers we’re collaborating with. Before we went to meet them, we played a fun survival game activity as a team-building warmup.

  When we met with the teachers, we did icebreakers to get to know each other better. My group had some fun with ChatGPT by giving it our personality types and asking what types of people we’d work best with—it sparked some good conversation and helped break the ice quickly. After lunch, we regrouped and explained the mini project assignments we completed the day before, reviewing the different ways we approached our data cleaning and merging tasks. Finally, we spent time reviewing our main project code and then transitioned into reading two new papers on Convolutional Neural Networks. One focused on Step 2: Max Pooling, while the other gave a full walkthrough of how convolution operations work. Both readings helped reinforce what we’ve learned and gave more technical context for the model we’ll eventually be building.

  No blockers today—everything went smoothly, and the team was able to stay on track with both presentations and code review.

reflection: |
  Today was a nice balance of technical focus and group interaction. Meeting the high school teachers added a new layer of collaboration, and reviewing CNN operations through detailed readings helped clarify the math and structure behind the models. I feel like everything is starting to connect more clearly, especially now that we’re applying what we’ve learned in multiple formats—from code to conversation to research.
