what_i_learned: |
  Today started with creating our Week 2 PowerPoint and recording a short video summarizing our project progress, accomplishments, goals, and next steps. It felt good to reflect on what I’ve done so far and start thinking ahead. Afterward, my group explored another research article connected to our project topic. We then dove deeper into the different models we might use for our solution, including convolutional neural networks for extracting image features, generative adversarial networks for creating synthetic data, convolutional autoencoders for compressing and denoising images, and diffusion models for generating data through a denoising process. We also reviewed the major types of learning used in AI, which include supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and self-supervised learning. To wrap up, we played another Kahoot game to test how much we remembered from the week about Python.

  The most challenging part of today was processing all the new information about the different models and learning types. It was a lot to take in at once, but I know with more time and repetition next week, I’ll understand it better.

reflection: |
  I really appreciated the balance between reflection, research, and learning today. Being introduced to more advanced models like convolutional autoencoders and diffusion methods was a bit overwhelming at first, but I’m excited to keep learning. Every day, I feel a little more confident navigating both the technical and research sides of the project.
