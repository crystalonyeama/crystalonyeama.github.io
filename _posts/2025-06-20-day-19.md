what_i_learned: |
  I was absent today and was unable to participate in the scheduled activities.

blockers: |
  Since I wasn’t present, I didn’t encounter any blockers related to the day’s work. I’ll be checking in with my group to catch up on anything I missed.

reflection: |
  Although I couldn’t attend, I plan to review any shared notes or code updates to stay aligned with my team and project goals.
