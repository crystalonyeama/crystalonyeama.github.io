what_i_learned: |
  Today kicked off the final week of the program with a full-group meeting where we reviewed all expectations moving forward. Instead of a weekly presentation, each group will be creating a 90-second elevator pitch video to summarize their project. We also went over the logistics of our final day event and what the closing activities will include.

  After that, we shifted our focus to finalizing our paper structure in Overleaf. We updated the document to include our finalized title, author names, affiliations, and the first few sections of the paper. This made our project feel even more real and publication-ready.

  After lunch, our group began outlining and drafting the script for our elevator pitch video, making sure to communicate our problem, approach, and impact in a clear and engaging way. We closed out the day by diving into the implementation of our DCAN model and made solid progress in setting up the architecture and training pipeline.

blockers: |
  No blockers today—just a busy and productive start to our final stretch.

reflection: |
  Seeing the project come together in both writing and code has been incredibly rewarding. The elevator pitch planning made us reflect on how to tell our story quickly and effectively, while our coding session gave us momentum for wrapping up the technical side. We're in the home stretch now!
