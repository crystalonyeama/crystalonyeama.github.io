what_i_learned: |
  Today we made major strides in moving beyond preprocessing and closer to model readiness. Our mentor Blessing has her own working script titled `main.code`, while we have been building a similar version named `skin_tone.code`. Blessing's code serves as a reference, helping us troubleshoot and improve our own implementation without copying directly. Using her guidance, we were finally able to resolve the image paths and successfully parse the images into a usable structure for our training pipeline.

  Although we made progress, we hit a small learning curve mid-day when we realized our code was starting to closely mirror Blessing's. This sparked a conversation in our group about making sure we’re not just replicating her logic—but genuinely learning from it.

  To make sure we could explain our decisions and logic clearly, we spent time going over both scripts line by line. This was a huge help in solidifying our understanding of parsing, path resolution, and data loading—all essential concepts for deep learning pipelines.

blockers: |
  It was a bit difficult to differentiate our implementation from the reference code without feeling like we were duplicating it. We had to pause and reevaluate how to take inspiration from the guide while maintaining our originality and understanding.

reflection: |
  Today reinforced the importance of understanding every line of code you write. It’s not enough to get something to work—you need to be able to explain the why behind it. Reviewing both our code and Blessing’s together helped bridge the gap between mimicking and mastering.
