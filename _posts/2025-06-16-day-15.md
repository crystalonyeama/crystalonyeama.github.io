what_i_learned: |
  Today we watched a series of ten videos that gave a strong overview of machine learning and deep learning concepts. The videos covered artificial neural networks, including their structure—input, hidden, and output layers—and how they are trained. We also learned about important concepts like loss functions, learning rates, and activation functions. The videos explained how data is split into training, validation, and testing sets, which helped reinforce why those stages are important in evaluating model performance. Afterward, we had a group discussion about the content, and I was happy that I was able to recall a lot of the information. It gave me a better foundation for understanding the kinds of models we’ll be using in our project, and it helped make some of the concepts we’ve heard before feel more concrete.

  In the second half of the day, we shifted to writing the abstract and introduction sections for our final paper, which we’ll be using to help guide our mid-summer project progress presentation. It was a challenge getting all four of us on the same page with how to write it, especially since we all had slightly different writing styles and ways of explaining things. Even though it was difficult to blend our ideas at times, we were able to finish a solid draft, and I’m proud of how far we’ve come.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but it was tough coordinating and combining everyone’s input while writing the abstract and introduction as a team.

reflection: |
  I appreciated today’s mix of structured learning and collaborative writing. Watching the videos helped me understand neural networks on a deeper level, and writing with my group pushed us to communicate better and compromise when needed. I’m looking forward to refining our draft and continuing to build on our model knowledge this week.
