what_i_learned: |
  Today we dove into Python conditionals and logical expressions, building a simple Student Grade Evaluator that used if/elif/else structures. I learned how Boolean logic works in code, and how Python evaluates multiple conditions step-by-step.

  We also explored the world of Generative AI. I now understand the difference between GenAI, ChatGPT, and the LLM Core behind it all. We learned how LLMs are trained using deep learning, neural networks, and transformer models to understand language. Seeing examples like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude made it clearer how these tools are used in real-world applications.

blockers: |
  Some of the logic behind conditionals was confusing at first—especially chaining comparisons like `3 > 2 > 1`. But working through examples in code helped it click. I also had to double-check my indentation since Python is picky about structure.

reflection: |
  The highlight was playing a game where we guessed whether images were AI-generated or not—it was surprisingly tricky! We wrapped up with a Kahoot quiz to reinforce Python and AI concepts, which made learning feel fun and competitive. I'm starting to see how code and AI come together to create powerful, interactive tools.
