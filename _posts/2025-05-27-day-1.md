what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git and GitHub are and how they’re used to track changes in code and collaborate with others. Some of the commands we practiced included `git status`, `git log`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. It was helpful to understand the workflow from making local changes to pushing them to a remote repository, and how Git functions as a distributed version control system.

  We also explored why version control is important when working in teams and how GitHub makes that easier. This was my first time using the terminal for version control, and it made me feel like a real developer.

reflection: |
  The day started off with energy and excitement. One of my favorite parts was the bingo icebreaker activity. We walked around the room asking each other questions to find matches for our bingo cards—things like: Have you ever done a hackathon? Do you know React? Java? Love math? Have a personal project? Want to build your own app someday? It was a fun way to connect and discover shared interests with other students.

  Overall, I really enjoyed meeting my group mates and getting a sense of the community here. It’s clear that this program is going to be both challenging and rewarding. I can’t wait to dive deeper and grow not just as a coder, but as a teammate and creator.
