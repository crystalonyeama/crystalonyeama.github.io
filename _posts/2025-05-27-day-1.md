what_i_learned: |
  I learned what Git and GitHub was, some of the commands learned were git status, git log, git clone, git add, git commit, and git push which was very informative. I also learned about making local changes and what the distributed Version Control System is.

blockers: |
  After taking the placement test I realized that I need quite a bit of help with Python.

reflection: |
    All together, I enjoyed meeting my group mates, and getting a understanding of where this program is going to be taking me. I can't wait to dive in deeper with more understanding of everything.
