what_i_learned: |
  Today was all about learning how to use the pandas package in Python, which is one of the most important tools for working with data. We began by reading through W3Schools and covered a wide range of topics, starting with the basics of pandas series and dataframes. From there, we learned how to read CSV and JSON files into pandas, which helps us work with external datasets in a structured format. We also explored how to analyze and clean data, which included identifying and dealing with empty cells, fixing data in the wrong format, correcting incorrect values, and removing duplicate rows. These cleaning steps are crucial for making sure the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis. 

  Toward the end of the reading, we explored how to calculate correlations between columns and how to use pandas to generate simple visualizations that help make the data easier to understand. After all the reading, we transitioned into Google Colab where we worked hands-on with a real practice dataset. This part was really useful because it gave me a chance to actually apply what I had just learned and see how each function works in context. I also got to observe how small changes in code can make a big difference in how the data is presented and interpreted.

  The most difficult part of today was remembering the exact format and syntax when writing the code. I often knew what the function was or what I was supposed to do, but the specific structure or punctuation would trip me up. I know it’ll get easier with practice.

reflection: |
  Even though working with a new package like pandas was a bit overwhelming at first, I enjoyed seeing how powerful it is for working with data. Using a real dataset in Google Colab helped make the reading material feel more real and applicable. I’m looking forward to becoming more confident with the syntax and getting faster at writing data analysis code from memory.
