what_i_learned: |
  Today was a continuation of our work with the pandas library in Python, and we dove deeper into data visualization. We focused on how to take the data we’re working with and create clear, readable plots that help others—especially those who aren't familiar with our project—understand the patterns and insights we've uncovered. We explored different plotting functions to display trends, comparisons, and relationships in the data. Being able to visualize the information we’ve cleaned and analyzed makes it a lot more impactful and easier to communicate.

  After lunch, we had two Kahoot quizzes. The first was a review of the machine learning models we’ve been discussing, such as CNNs, GANs, DCANs, and diffusion models. It was a good reminder of what each model is best used for and how they apply to different types of data. The second Kahoot focused on the pandas material we’ve been studying from W3Schools and applying in our Google Colab practice notebooks. These games helped reinforce our understanding while making the learning experience more interactive and fun.

  In the afternoon, we returned to scholarly research for our projects. I found two new articles that helped expand my understanding of current methods used in dermatology-related AI. Reading through them gave me ideas on how to potentially shape or improve parts of my own approach. We ended the day by each choosing one article to share aloud and explaining why it stood out to us. It was great hearing different perspectives and seeing how everyone is connecting technical learning to real-world impact.

blockers: |
  My biggest blocker today was trying to keep up with my mentor, Blessing, when she was introducing new code for us to use with the pandas library. Sometimes the explanations moved quickly, and I needed more time to fully process what was being shown.

reflection: |
  I liked that today combined different learning methods—hands-on coding, group quizzes, and article research. It made the day feel balanced and productive. Even though I struggled a bit to follow some of the new code, I’m proud of the articles I found and how much more confident I’m becoming with pandas. I’m definitely going to review the new functions Blessing introduced so I can keep up better next time.
