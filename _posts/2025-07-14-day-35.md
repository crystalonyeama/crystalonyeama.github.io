  Today we wrapped up the last stage of data cleaning and preprocessing. We reviewed all seven datasets, dropped columns we found irrelevant, and kept only those that we believe are essential for accurately classifying the skin lesion images. This included refining our focus on key features like fitzpatrick_skin_type, anatom_site_general, and other clinical metadata.

  With the cleaned datasets in place, we started diving deeper into how we could integrate DCAN, Grad-CAM, and SHAP into our modeling pipeline. These algorithms not only improve interpretability but also help reveal what features the model is learning from during classification.

  At the end of the day, we watched and provided feedback on two other group presentations. It was helpful to see different approaches and offer both encouragement and constructive critique.

  One challenge was deciding which algorithm is the best fit for our classification task. Each method offers different insights, so understanding how to integrate them without complicating our workflow too much is still something we’re figuring out.

reflection: |
  Wrapping up data cleaning across all seven datasets felt like a major accomplishment. With that done, we’re now shifting gears into modeling and implementation. I also really appreciated seeing how other teams presented their work—it gave me ideas for how to improve our own.
