  Today we wrapped up the last stage of data cleaning and preprocessing. We reviewed all seven datasets, dropped columns we found irrelevant, and kept only those we believe are essential for accurately classifying the skin lesion images. This included refining our focus on key features like `fitzpatrick_skin_type`, `anatom_site_general`, and other clinical details.

  With the datasets cleaned and aligned, we began looking deeper into how we could incorporate the classification algorithms we’ve been exploring—DCAN, Grad-CAM, and SHAP—into our modeling pipeline. We're aiming not only for improved accuracy but also for enhanced interpretability.

  To close out the day, we watched and evaluated two other group presentations from last week. We submitted thoughtful feedback for two different students, offering both encouragement and constructive suggestions.

  The challenge now lies in selecting the best-fit algorithm for our specific dataset structure, and understanding how to fully integrate it into our pipeline without disrupting the current workflow.

  We’ve hit a major milestone by completing the cleaning and structuring of all seven datasets. Now that our data is in great shape, we’re ready to shift our energy toward implementation and testing. The feedback session also reminded me how important it is to stay engaged with our peers and learn from their approaches too.
