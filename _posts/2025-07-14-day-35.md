what_i_learned: |
  Today we made meaningful progress as we transitioned from data cleaning into feature selection and modeling prep. 
  After finishing up the final touches on our cleaned datasets, we began by dropping unnecessary columns and 
  carefully selecting the attributes we want to include for image classification.

  We completed this process across all 7 datasets and started researching how to best integrate them using the 
  algorithms we explored last week—Grad-CAM, SHAP, and DCAN. This stage is crucial because the quality of our features 
  will directly affect the performance of our image classification model.

  Toward the end of the day, we spent time reviewing other groups’ weekly presentation videos and left comments for 
  two peers as part of our program’s feedback activity.

blockers: |
  None today. Things moved smoothly and we had a clear direction thanks to our prep last week.

reflection: |
  Seeing all seven datasets finally cleaned and aligned felt like a big win. It’s rewarding to see how each day 
  of consistent work adds up. The next challenge will be testing which algorithms perform best—and figuring out 
  how to fine-tune them for our specific use case.
