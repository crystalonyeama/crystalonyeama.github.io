  Today was a productive step forward in getting ready for our mid-summer presentation. We began by building out the slides for our group presentation, focusing on data collection, preprocessing, model plans, and progress to date. While we were able to get most of the slide deck completed, there were still a few sections we left unfinished—particularly the data visualization and preliminary analysis slides—because our mentor Blessing wasn’t present to help guide final decisions. I held off on inserting the graphs I’d created for data visualization until I could confirm they were appropriate for our analysis.

  After that, we turned our attention to an issue we’d been encountering in our training pipeline: the model wasn't recognizing all of the image files properly. It turned out that some of the images didn’t have file extensions, which was causing the process to break. We resolved this by adding extensions and improving how the script handles file formatting.

  In the afternoon, we had a very insightful lecture from our faculty mentor, Dr. Pramanik, who walked us through the biology of skin, the different layers, classifications of skin tones, and the medical background of skin cancer—including causes, risk factors, and diagnostic challenges. This context helped us ground our technical work in the real-world medical problem we’re trying to solve.

  We closed the day with more literature review, identifying new scholarly articles that could further inform our model design, dataset considerations, and fairness techniques. Overall, it was a well-rounded day of both technical and conceptual development.

  The absence of our mentor made it difficult to finalize parts of our presentation, particularly around visualizations. We also encountered issues with inconsistent image file formats that required troubleshooting in our model training pipeline.

reflection: |
  Even though there were a few delays in finalizing some elements, today gave me a better sense of how our work fits into the bigger picture. From technical fixes to medical background and presentation polish, everything feels like it’s starting to come together. I’m gaining confidence in both the material and my contributions to the team.
