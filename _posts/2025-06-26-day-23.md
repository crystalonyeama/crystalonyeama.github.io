what_i_learned: |
  Today was focused on two key areas: continuing our literature review process and reviewing the updated code that our mentor, Blessing, modified to support our model development. We spent the majority of the day reading through scholarly articles relevant to our project to deepen our understanding of both the medical context and the technical strategies behind multimodal skin cancer detection.

  In the second half of the day, we worked closely with the revised codebase. Blessing had made several important modifications to improve how our model processes and trains on the merged dataset. As a group, we walked through the updates together, making sure we understood the logic behind each change and how it addressed previous bugs and inefficiencies. It was helpful to break down the code line by line and get clarification on areas we were confused about.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today, but reviewing and fully understanding the modified code required extra focus and collaboration. We're still learning how each function ties into the model’s overall performance.

reflection: |
  While the day was heavy on reading and code walkthroughs, it was valuable in terms of progress. The literature reviews gave us more background knowledge, and the code session helped build our confidence in understanding how the model operates. As we prepare for tomorrow’s presentation, it feels good knowing we’ve strengthened both our technical foundation and our teamwork.
